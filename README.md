In this project, I aimed to experiment with different cloud environments and gain experience in communicating between various services. I developed a mobile application using Microsoft's new technology MAUI (Multi-platform App UI). My application focused on communicating using a database hosted on Azure and with a web service running on Docker in a Google Cloud environment.(Development is continue)
